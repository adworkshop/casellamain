      <div class="peopleGroupingTeaser">Our Commitment: We strive to cultivate a culture of lifelong learning and growth, in which all Casella employees can access career development pathways to develop their technical and leadership skills and advance their careers within the company.</div>

      <div class="twoColumnContentContainer">
        <p>Throughout this report we have described our commitment to resource renewal, focusing on the physical materials we manage. However, we firmly believe that our most important resource is our people, and our ethic of resource renewal informs the way we treat them. Our approach to renewing and sustaining our people is depicted in the figure here. Everything at Casella revolves around our core values and our safety culture. Through a series of programs focused on sourcing, engagement, development, and opportunity, we continuously invest in the renewal of our people. When we do this well, we create a virtuous cycle of employee retention, enhanced productivity, and improved customer satisfaction. This in turn gives us increased capacity to invest further in our people, and the beneficial cycle continues.</p>

                      <p>The men and women who work in the solid waste industry operate heavy-duty vehicles, work on busy streets, and navigate difficult terrain in every type of weather. They run and repair equipment specifically designed to convey, compact, perforate, grind, pulp, and shred. This type of work can be dangerous and unforgiving of even the smallest mistakes.</p>
                      <p>Protection of employee health and safety is the top priority in all of our operations. At the heart of our safety program is our dedicated safety department, working hand-in-hand with our operating teams to get every employee home to his or her family at the end of each day.</p>
                      <p>Our safety success begins with hiring; a commitment to the safety of yourself and your team is a prerequisite for employment with Casella. It continues with new hire training, ongoing training, and thousands of daily decisions and actions that add up to a safe day.</p>
                      <p>One of the largest safety risk factors in our business is beyond our direct control. Our drivers share the roads with members of the general public who are increasingly hurried, stressed, and distracted. To remind everyone to take caution near solid waste vehicles and their operators, we support <em>Slow Down to Get Around</em> legislation in all states where we operate. So far, the legislation has passed in 18 states, including New York and Vermont. We are lobbying for other northeastern states to pass these measures.</p>

                      <p>When we apply a resource renewal mindset to the way we manage our people, the final step in closing the loop is to provide opportunities for advancement and promotions within the company. We currently fill approximately 50% of our non-entry level positions with internal candidates. We strive to increase that number to 80%. At this targeted rate of retention, our people will have ample opportunity to grow and advance within the organization, and we will also continue to import a healthy amount of new perspective and diversity of thought through outside hires.</p>
                      <p class="last">Achieving this 80% goal will require a consistent and disciplined approach to our sourcing, engagement, and development strategies.

                      <p>Engaged employees are proud stewards of our organization. They bring their best self to work every day. They go above and beyond for their customers.

                      <p><strong>Great Drivers &amp; Great Technicians:</strong><br />Our company’s success flows from the enduring commitment of our drivers and mechanics, and their daily dedication to service and safety. In today’s economy, commercial drivers and fleet technicians are in high demand, and we need to attract and retain the best of the best: the talented men and women who will deliver the highest standards of safety, service, and leadership every day. With our innovative new approach to talent management, we provide our drivers and mechanics with continuing opportunities to learn and grow, and a compensation program that increases along with their contributions and capabilities.</p>
                      
                      <p><strong>Customer Care:</strong><br />Our customer care representatives participate in a comprehensive training program focused on customer service excellence and continuous improvement. Our structured career path helps us to attract and retain the best people. Every employee starts out as a CCR (customer care representative) and works their way through CCR1 and CCR2 as they fine-tune their skills, gain experience, and build confidence. Top performers can aspire to become a Senior Care representative, and eventually a trainer or a Team Manager. Representatives also learn and are incentivized to sell our services. All promotions stem from performance and character, as opposed to tenure.</p>
                      
                      <p><strong>Sales:</strong><br />As new technologies emerge, infrastructure shifts, and goals advance, our customers need more from us than ever before. To meet these new expectations, our specialized operating divisions must collaborate seamlessly, and our customer account representatives need to become fluent in a growing list of services and solutions. Our inter-regional sales round tables and workshops provide growth opportunities for our sales teams to learn new skills and collaborate with their peers to offer an integrated suite of exciting and effective resource solutions for their customers.</p>
                      
                      <p><strong>Impact Leadership:</strong><br />The development of our people is one of our most important strategic initiatives. Leadership at Casella is not limited by title or role. It is a daily practice and expectation of every Casella employee. We all lead through the power of example and our ability to solve problems. We regularly invite our employees to build their leadership skills through retreats and round tables. With a nuanced and holistic understanding of leadership, regular reflection, and a commitment to personal growth, we work together to become better leaders for our company, our customers, our families, and our communities.</p>

              <p>As a locally-focused company, we are proud of all the great things we can do to support and engage with our communities. Our local teams sponsor events, donate services, and volunteer their time and talents. In so many ways, we are woven into the civic fabric of our communities.</p>
              <p>We also work to provide our communities with valuable educational resources – including facility tours, classroom talks, community mailers, and more – to help our neighbors learn how and why to recycle, where their waste goes, and much more.</p>
              <p>In 2017, we made charitable contributions totaling $70,384, donated thousands of hours of service, and hosted hundreds of community events and tours. In addition to reflecting our core values, we see these activities as a smart business investment, helping us to cultivate customers who are proud to hire us, employees who are proud to work for us, and communities who are proud to host us.</p>

                  <div class="commEngageTxt">One of the biggest ways that we engage with our customers is through recycling education. When everybody knows how to recycle better, we make sure that recycling remains environmentally and economically sustainable. We currently offer a variety of educational resources to our customers, including an annual mailer for households, customized signage for businesses, train-the-trainer services, and recycling facility tours. Still, we have lots of ideas to enhance our recycling education programs, and we’ll be rolling those out over the coming months.</div>

                  <div class="commEngageTxt">Have you ever wondered where your waste and recyclables go after you throw them "away?" To answer this question, we host facility tours and open houses. We are proud of our operations and eager to show them off. Over the years, some of our annual events have evolved from simple tours into full-fledged community get-togethers drawing as many as a thousand people. At the end of our tours, our visitors understand exactly where "away" is. As we noted in our page 23 case study, we hope this awareness will help to inform ongoing thoughtful discussions about the future of solid waste management in all of our communities.</div>
