            <p>The largest emission reduction over the past year came from the closure of our only waste-to-energy incineration facility. The Maine Energy Recovery Company (MERC) facility emitted roughly 100,000 Mg CO2e (metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents) per year. With the closure of the operation at the end of 2012, and full dismantling of the facility over the course of 2013-2014, we eliminated those combustion emissions from our carbon footprint.</p>
            <p>MERC processed roughly 200,000 tons of MSW per year, and these tons did not simply disappear with the closure of the facility. Much of this tonnage has been redirected to other landfill facilities, each of which has a lower carbon footprint than MERC in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) per ton. So the net impact of the decision to close the facility will be a decrease in disposal emissions.</p>
            <p>Additional emission reductions were achieved through continued improvements to the gas collection systems at our landfills, as well as through fuel and energy efficiency measures in our fleet and facilities.</p>
            <p>Since joining the voluntary EPA Climate Leaders program eight years ago, we have drastically reduced our overall carbon footprint. We now intend to continue our climate leadership within the industry by turning our attention to smaller emission reduction projects. Our goal will be to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations.</p>

                        <p>In 2005 we set a goal to reduce our overall diesel consumption by 10% or roughly 580,000 gallons by 2013. In pursuit of this goal we implemented various fuel efficiency measures and began transitioning some of our fleet to run on compressed natural gas (CNG), which is a cleaner-burning alternative to diesel. Our 35 CNG vehicles displace approximately 400,000 gallons of diesel fuel per year, reducing carbon emissions while also improving local air quality.</p>
                        <p>Despite these initiatives, our fleet efficiency improvements have not kept pace with growth in our collection business, and we have not yet achieved our goal of reducing our overall diesel consumption by 10%.</p>

Our facility energy usage makes up a small portion of our overall greenhouse gas emissions, but beyond climate benefits, efficiencies in this area will help to improve local air quality and reduce local operating costs.</p>
                        <p>In 2009 we set a goal to reduce our electricity and stationary natural gas consumption by 5%. The following measures helped us to make progress toward these targets:</p>
                        <p><span>Natural Gas:</span> Prior to its closure, the Maine Energy facility consumed over 500,000 therms per year of natural gas. The decommissioning of this facility slashed our stationary natural gas consumption and reduced our total usage by roughly 75%, allowing us to achieve our goal.</p>
                        <p><span>Electricity:</span> Since 2009, we have implemented efficiency measures such as lighting retrofits and the installation of timers for our vehicle plug-in stations. However these improvements did not keep pace with increases in electricity usage elsewhere in our footprint, so we have not yet achieved our electricity reduction target.</p>
