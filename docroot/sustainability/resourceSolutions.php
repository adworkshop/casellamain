              <p>With a strong commitment to achieving 75% waste reduction by 2016, Tompkins County in upstate New York is always on the cutting edge of municipal recycling. Most recently, the County has set their sights on residential food scraps recycling, making great strides in the past two years. Through a grant-funded pilot that began in 2012, the County is offering free curbside food scraps collection for roughly 1,200 households. Participants received 13-gallon carts, kitchen caddies, compostable liners, and educational materials, and are encouraged to set out their food scraps for weekly collection and delivery to Cayuga Compost in Trumansburg. Casella is proud to provide the collection service for this important trial. County residents can also recycle their food scraps by bringing them to one of five available drop spot locations, or by drawing upon County and Cornell Cooperative Extension support for backyard composting.</p>

              <p>Becton Dickinson is a global medical technology company that manufactures and sells medical and diagnostic equipment. With Casella's support, the company has developed a successful resource management program, including on-site staff, unified invoicing, monthly performance reports, accessible data dashboards, and ongoing associate education. Under the program, BD is recycling 7,000 tons/year of plastic, 5,000 tons per year of fiber, and 2,000 tons per year of metal and glass. Excitingly, Casella and BD are currently developing a closed-loop recycling program that would beneficially reuse 2,500 tons per year of production waste polypropylene.</p>

              <p>The solid residuals produced at wastewater treatment facilities contain carbon and nutrients that can help to build soils. Still a large percentage of this material is typically disposed in landfills or incinerators. The Lewiston-Auburn Pollution Control Authority in Maine is committed to recycling 100% of their biosolids. To do this, they operate their own compost facility and work with us to complete direct land application of their Class B biosolids in season. Our talented project managers work tirelessly to find suitable fields and coordinate scheduling as dictated by field owner's needs, plant production, and the always unpredictable northeastern weather.</p>

              <p>Skidmore College had established a goal to achieve 40% recycling by the end of 2014. However, it faced challenges with staff training, communication, data access and signage, and actual recycling performance hovered around 16%. Casella spent time understanding the college's needs, efficiently implemented Zero-Sort Recycling, and began providing monthly data reports. We increased sustainability awareness through co-branded signage, presentations for faculty and staff, and regular waste audits with students and faculty. This increased the recycling rate to 28%, with peak monthly rates of 40% in May and June 2014. The school is also now able to capture and divert increased volumes during move-out periods.</p>
              <div class="resourcesQuote">"From the quarterly meetings and conference calls to the overall support we've received, even including our local Casella sales rep sorting trash with us, it has been a very pleasant process.

The organization needed a reliable waste management partner to help managers and staff to minimize time spent on waste and recycling. Casella coordinated the delivery of nearly 170 solid waste and recycling containers, and implemented Zero-Sort Recycling at the majority of locations, simplifying the recycling process and diverting more material from the waste stream. By also optimizing collection frequencies and right-sizing containers, we were able to help reduce Bertucci's solid waste costs and increase recycling.</p>

Patients at the center need to focus their full energy on getting healthy, and understandably lack time or interest to understand complicated waste sorting rules. Casella helped CVPH implement Zero-Sort Recycling in patient rooms, and created a centralized system to help employees understand the ease of the program for increasing recycling. CVPH has also partnered with Casella to launch a composting program. As a result, 850,000 pounds is being diverted from disposal, and the program helps to reduce costs.</p>
