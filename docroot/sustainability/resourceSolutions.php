              <div class="indResourceTxt">Manufacturers have been pursuing waste reduction for decades and are often the farthest along in their journey to reduce and even eliminate waste. They tend to be motivated by process efficiency and cost minimization imperatives, and a need to meet and exceed environmental sustainability targets without distracting from their core business. They have disciplined and well-trained employees and exercise a relatively high degree of control over what enters and exits their plants. Most importantly, the unique waste streams they produce are not suited for traditional blue bin recycling programs, but through professional management, can yield substantial value. See the Lebanon ARC example below that shows how we do this with our innovative ARC&trade; approach.</div>

They support diverse services ranging from dining halls to research laboratories and tend to be compartmentalized into relatively isolated departments. Four-year schools, by definition, have annual turnover rates of 25% and require extra training. Much of the material flowing through campus is purchased through a centralized procurement office, but much is also imported by students and visitors. For these reasons and more, successful resource management in these settings requires much more than placing out a bunch of recycling bins.</div>

The challenges they face include weak channels of communication with residents, along with turnover and language barriers. Unlike factories, municipalities have essentially no control over the types of materials their residents purchase and discard, so their services must support traditional curbside recycling as well as bulky items, household hazardous waste, yard debris, food waste, and more. Meeting ambitious resource management goals requires overcoming all of these barriers.</div>

          <h2 class="resourcesActionTitle">Aggregation &amp; Recovery Collaboratives</h2>
          <div class="resourcesActionSubTitle">On their journey to zero waste, many of our customers have reached a point where the path gets steeper. They are recycling their cardboard, metal, and other "traditional" recyclables. They have programs in place for food waste. The dominant streams in their waste dumpsters are now items like plastic tubing, wooden reels, film plastics, packaged food and beverages, label backing, and more. What fills their dumpsters today is a miscellany of stuff that is unique to their business, with no off-the-shelf recovery solution.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="recycleUpperContentContainer twoColumnContentContainer" style="margin-top: 30px; -webkit-column-gap: 60px;  -moz-column-gap: 60px; column-gap: 60px;">
          <p>This lack of easy solutions often doesn’t reflect a lack of recovery value. In fact, many of these items may be quite valuable when in the right quantities and in the right place. To capture these materials, we have begun developing and deploying Aggregation &amp; Recovery Collaboratives (ARC&trade;), through which local organizations come together to establish practical resource recovery operations tailored to their unique needs.</p>
          <p>We established our first ARC in Lebanon, NH, with Hypertherm, a manufacturer of industrial cutting systems. The operation, detailed in the side bar to the right, has helped to increase that company’s recycling rate from 43% to over 97%, while also serving others throughout the region.</p>
          <h3>Benefits</h3>
          <p>ARCs enable innovative recovery solutions through risk- and reward-sharing, aggregation and densification technologies, and efficient access to reuse and recycling markets. The model can be replicated in any geography, and tailored to handle any combination of materials, allowing for the recovery of numerous items that were previously considered “unrecoverable.” Although these items are often lightweight, they have high embedded energy, carbon, and other resource value, and are highly worthwhile to recover.</p>
          <h3>Business Model</h3>
          <p>ARCs have an innovative, yet flexible, business model built around aligned incentives, modular equipment, and revenue transparency. The scope extends from point-of-generation through to commodity marketing.  The specifics of property ownership, revenue sharing, and contractual relationships are established on a case-by-case basis. The approach resists "technology for the sake of technology" and focuses instead on practical problem-solving and a “get the job done” attitude.</p>
          <h3>Innovative Partnerships</h3>
          <p>Establishing a successful ARC requires very close collaboration and a pioneering spirit among the partnering stakeholders. Casella brings expertise in logistics, handling, processing equipment, and commodity markets. Generator partners bring a commitment to waste reduction, volumes of recyclable items, and in some cases, tangible assets such as equipment, vehicles, or warehouse space. Most importantly, all partners contribute a willingness to work together to create enduring solutions to serve their unique local materials recovery needs.</p>
