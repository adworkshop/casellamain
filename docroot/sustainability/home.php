          <h2 class="homeSection2">About This Report</h2>
          
          <p>To keep our stakeholders apprised of our progress toward our resource renewal vision, we issue a biennial sustainability report. To be sure that our report is a rigorous assessment of our sustainability impact, rather than just a selection of feel-good stories, we follow a widely-respected reporting framework developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). <strong>This year's report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option.</strong> These standards are built upon the following principles:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Stakeholder Inclusiveness:</strong> In preparing our report, we strive to consider the perspectives of six key stakeholder groups: Customers, Employees, Communities, Government, Shareholders, and Vendors.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability Context:</strong> Throughout our report, we describe the ways that our sustainability initiatives will bring our actions and impacts into alignment with broader societal goals and environmental limits.</li>
            <li><strong>Materiality:</strong> We report on the topics that are important to our stakeholders and that reflect our largest economic, environmental, and social impacts. These are described in the table below.</li>
            <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> We strive to provide a full picture of the material sustainability issues within our operational boundaries that best reflect the impacts of our business since our last report.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Materiality:</h3>
          <p>Through internal surveys reflecting ongoing conversations with external stakeholders, we identify the issues that are both important to our stakeholders and that reflect our largest economic, environmental, and social impacts. We review these results alongside those identified through our enterprise risk management process. The table below summarizes the results of that process.</p>
          <p><em>Time Period: This report is current through mid-2018. Most data points are current as of 12/31/2017, unless otherwise noted.</em></p>

          <p>At Casella, our mission is to protect the environment and strengthen our local communities, and grow our business by creating value from society’s waste streams. We create this value for our people, our customers, and our shareholders by seeing the opportunities in emerging and accelerating local, national, and global trends. For example, when faced with challenges like the collapse of the global recycling market, the circular economy, or various regulatory constraints, our expertise and more than 40 years of experience enables us to create value through a nimble approach to sustainable materials management.</p>
          
          <p>Arising from our northeastern U.S. roots, sustainability, in all aspects of the word – people, business, and the environment – is integral to our strategy. We continue to focus our efforts on building critical infrastructure to meet the demands of our society while developing and investing in innovative solutions to support the needs for generations to come. In addition, we are building on a legacy marked by steadfast community stewardship, a sustained focus on offering a great place to work and grow, and delivering environmental solutions which have meaningful returns for our customers and shareholders.</p>
          
          <p>I spend a lot of my time visiting with customers, regulatory and legislative bodies, and our people. It is in each of these discussions that I learn not only about the numerous and complex sustainability challenges that our local communities face, but also how our teams are addressing issues every day for their customers with smart, innovative solutions. Global and local shifts make what we do both simple and complex. Simple? Provide a necessary, everyday service that needs to be efficient, reliable, and cost-effective. Complex? Meet those needs in a rapidly changing local, national, and global environment.</p>

          <p>We are thoughtfully managing and approaching these challenges with practical solutions, recognizing both today’s technological limitations and tomorrow’s possibilities. There are a number of challenges woven throughout this report:</p>

          <p>First, <strong>recycling is in crisis</strong> globally and right here at home. Our actions in response to this challenge will have a significant impact on both the economic sustainability of recycling as well as the environmental sustainability it promises. We must solve this problem – creatively, urgently, and collaboratively.</p>

          <p>Secondly, our society’s evolution towards resource management and sustainability requires a deep understanding of the importance of the entire spectrum of our solid waste infrastructure. At this moment in history, <strong>this infrastructure is deeply integrated</strong>, with each component playing an important role – even landfills. These roles can be – and are – either waxing or waning, but each is key to the bridge we are building to the ideal future where there is no waste, only resources to be given new life.</p>

          <p>Next, when it comes to waste and recycling, and resource management, the needs and expectations of many of our customers are growing, in both scope and intensity. This, too, is evolutionary, and ripe with opportunities for progress in the sustainability of resources. Our vision is to bring these <strong>creative, innovative resource solutions</strong> into the mainstream of how we serve an even broader range of customers and tackle a broader range of sustainability challenges.</p>

          <p class="homeLetterTitle">We are making progress:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Recycling over 1M tons per year of organics and recyclables</li>
            <li>Reducing GHG emissions by over 50%</li>
            <li>Enhancing our programs to develop our people</li>
          </ol>

          <p>A note about balance: environmental sustainability – a noble and necessary goal – must be paired with an equally strong commitment to financial sustainability. Without this balance, without a goal of profitability, our ability to make lasting, meaningful impacts on the sustainability of our environment and our resources is limited. In short, we can do good, and do well – proving to the world that solving the challenges of sustainability and resource limitations is good business, and the most significant economic development opportunity in a generation.</p>

          <p>In the pages that follow, you will find a lot more detail around how our business and our strategy is intricately woven around our embrace for sustainability and creating innovative solutions that build a better tomorrow. What excites me most about the years ahead is the team that we are building to advance our mission and to bring you – our customers, policy-makers, regulators and communities – the next generation of leaders in sustainable materials management.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your interest in Casella and for reading our Sustainability Report. I hope this brings you closer to understanding our beliefs and the actions we are taking to solve the resource challenges we face.</p>

      <div class="twoColumnContentContainer">
        <p>For decades, organizations across the country have sought to increase recycling rates by encouraging people to put more items in their recycling bins. Unfortunately, this practice benefits no one if those items are not actually recyclable.</p>
        <p>It is time to pause and remember why we recycle. Many have come to believe, simplistically, that the benefit of recycling comes from keeping stuff out of landfills. This ignores the crucial fact that environmental impact of landfilling is negligible compared to the extraction and transportation activities that produced them. <em><strong>The great promise of recycling</strong> is not that we can eliminate landfills, but that we can eliminate mining and deforestation.</em></p>
        <p>A myopic focus on "diversion" has distracted everyone from the daunting but essential work of building a resource-cycling economy in which today's discards consistently become the raw material for tomorrow's new products. With this report, we hope to reset the conversation, reminding everyone that recycling is far from simple, and it doesn't begin or end at the recycling bin. To endure, recycling solutions must be practical, they must be environmentally, economically, and socially-sustainable, and they must be embedded in a resource renewal economy that transforms the supply chains of everything we purchase and consume.</p>

            <h3>Resource Renewal</h3>
          </div>
          <p>We envision a resource renewal future in which nothing would be wasted, resource extraction would be all but eliminated, and human society could come into alignment with natural systems.</p>
          <p>Achieving resource renewal will not be easy. Roughly 50% of the waste from U.S. homes and businesses consists of materials that could be recycled or composted using technology available today. We need to get those materials into the right bins; but that will get us only halfway to our goal. The rest of the journey will require tougher steps: stop buying stuff that isn’t recyclable, engage suppliers to redesign for recyclability, purchase products made from recovered materials, and invest in the next wave of resource recovery infrastructure.</p>
          <p>To advance resource renewal, we are helping our customers set smart goals and providing them with a growing suite of Resource Solutions to help them achieve those goals. (Section 1 defines and describes our Resource Solutions). Still, we know that success will require much more. Our progress will be helped or hindered by systemic factors such as markets, policy, technology, culture, and infrastructure. Only by aligning all of these stakeholders and forces will society achieve resource renewal. This "puzzle" is adjacent.</p>
          <h4>It Begins with Smart Resource Renewal Goals</h4>
          <p>We have thousands of customers, including manufacturers, colleges, schools, hospitals, small businesses, municipalities, and households, who are actively working to reduce their waste. The most dedicated among them are working with us to set smart resource renewal goals that are data-driven and achievable. We provide these customers with resource renewal plans that go far beyond improved sorting to also include source reduction, procurement policies, supply chain engagement, and more.</p>
          <p>With our Core Values as our guide, and decades-long relationships to build upon, we have been fortunate to forge many strong partnerships to advance resource renewal in our region.</p>
          <h4>Innovative &amp; Reliable Resource Solutions</h4>
          <p>As one of the leading resource management companies in the country, we are extremely proud of our high-quality environmental services, which we call resource solutions: recycling, organics, collection, energy, and landfills. With over 2,000 employees, 100+ facilities, 500+ front-line vehicles, and over 40 years of experience, we collect, aggregate, sort, process, market, and manage our customers’ discards every day.</p>
          <p>Every day, we apply our experience and our expertise to enhance our  resource solutions and to imagine and develop new ones that propel us into the future. We take an approach of disciplined innovation, seeking the ideas, models, and technologies that fit into a holistic resource management infrastructure for the customers we serve. One of our most exciting areas of investment today is in the development of our people and their resource renewal expertise. A growing number of customers value us not only as providers of the tangible services above, but also as providers of the knowledge and data that help them achieve their goals. Thus, we are rapidly enhancing our professional services such as data reporting, on-site management, waste reduction, life cycle assessment, strategic sourcing and logistics, supply chain analysis, and more. These skills will be fundamental to achieving our customers' goals as well as the broader resource renewal vision.</p>
          <h4>Systemic Change in Markets, Policy, Technology, Culture, &amp; Infrastructure</h4>
          <p>With the strong partnerships, smart goals, and resource renewal expertise described above, we will continue to drive progress toward the vision of resource renewal. However, we know that even the best programs eventually come up against the law of diminishing returns: early projects save money, then some projects even, but eventually we come up against waste streams that are too costly to prevent or recover. At this point, bigger change is required.</p>
          <p>Only deep systemic change will drive solutions for the hardest-to-recycle materials, or prevent them from being generated in the first place. Markets and culture need to reward waste reduction and diversion. New technology and infrastructure need to enable diversion of more materials. Smart policy will sometimes need to nudge things along.</p>

          <div class="homeSection4ColumnContainerRightTeaser">This graphic depicts our role in the resource renewal cycle (also known as the circular economy). It shows the path that all products follow as they flow from raw materials into products and back again. Our job is to provide innovative Resource Solutions to help close the loop when environmental, social, and economic factors align to put materials to a higher and better use. The disposal arrow is for items that are not yet suitable for recovery. The lightning bolts indicate opportunities for energy capture.</div>

        <p>To endure, recycling programs must be built on a solid foundation of environmental, economic, and social sustainability. In other words, sustainable recycling solutions must do three things: 1) measurably enhance <strong>environmental stewardship</strong>, 2) demonstrate <strong>economic viability</strong> and sound financial returns, and 3) deliver <strong>social benefit</strong> including improved health, safety, and quality of life for people throughout the supply chain.</p>
        <p><strong>Holistic solutions needed:</strong> The stuff you buy has a large environmental footprint, and less than 5% of it comes from end-of-life collection, processing, and disposal. This means that simply moving discards from one bin to another is not enough. To tackle the other 95% of the environmental footprint, society has to design more of its stuff to be durable and recyclable with a high amount of recycled content. We need holistic recycling solutions designed to capture not only quantity, but quality.</p>
