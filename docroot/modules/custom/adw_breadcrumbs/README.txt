ADW Breadcrumbs
--------------------

Initial setup based on example code pulled from the Current Page Crumb
module by Greg Boggs.
https://www.drupal.org/project/current_page_crumb
https://www.drupal.org/u/greg-boggs

If the current page is in the main menu then the breadcrumbs are based
on the parent menu items with the unlinked page title as the last crumb.
If the page is not in the main nav the only the unlinked title is added
to the breadcrumb.
